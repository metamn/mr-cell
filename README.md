# mr-cell

A cell component in React.
It is the second lesson after React TicTacToe.

## Technologies

### Styled components

### Storybook

It is basically the de-facto development environment.

- All component features are documented here as a story.
- If a new feature is added a new story is created.
- After all stories are OK we can say the component works.

Uses the following addons:

- Console: to show warnings, the prints to `console.log`
- Notes: to add dev notes like why this feature is not working, how to fix it, etc.
- Knobs: it would be a tremendous help to stress test the component; unfortunately currently is not fully working.

### Jest

- should be run with `sudo npm run test`
